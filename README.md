# Utilities

A collection of various utility modules that extend Elixir's core modules.

## Installation

This library is currently not available [Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish) and thus should be installed as a Git dependency. This can be done by adding `utilities` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:utilities, git: "https://github.com/bmitc/elixir-utilities.git", branch: "main"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/utilities>.
